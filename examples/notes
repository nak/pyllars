if pointer:
   needs method added to 'get object at index' returning pythong object of dereferenced type ("at(index)")

   dealloc overriden to not delete _CObject, but to set to null

   init overriden to only accept a python derferenced type wrappper object as argument (and only argument)

   method to derefence pointer object (= "at(0)")


Can't do this to arbitrary depth????
   use void* pointer;
   track depth
   at depth 0, return real object
   create pointer python method to used this
